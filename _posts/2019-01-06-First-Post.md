title: The best advice ever!
---

When it comes to eye contact I can gladly assert that I am not the only one who gets mired in dread 
and experiences moments of pure awkwardness. Apart from the generic eyeball plea which always proves 
effective when asking for assistance, the former rarely feels like poetry. I had to do something to rid
myself of this predicament in a bid of increasing my chances for a successful interview. A dear friend of 
mine recommended that I read Pitch Perfect by Bill McGowan, which I read voraciously in search of the antidote!
His trick is that one moderately stares at a man's sideburns or earrings of a woman when one is uncomfortable. 
Inherent in this maneuver is that there is not much of a discernible variation and none will notice the slight askewness. A
nother trick Kara Ronin, a career expert, is drawing a triangle on the other persons face and moderately shifting from the 
different points of the triangle during the conversation. Both produce the desired effect thus, creating a conducive 
atmosphere for one to flesh out details and provide a coherent answer to the interviewer while exuding an aura of confidence. 

This is Golden!

Thank you for reading.
